    "# Linear Algebra Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra is the study of linear equations.\n",
    "While linear algebra is a very robust and extensive field of mathematics, we will only need a little bit of the basic concepts for our purposes in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we introduce the main definitions which we will be relying on.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalars**, **vectors**, **matrices**, and **tensors** are mathematical objects that contain numbers.\n",
    "We typically think of these objects as having numbers arranged in a particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **scalar** is simply a single number and is zero-dimensional.\n",
    "- A **vector** is an ordered list of numbers and is one-dimensional. A vector is similar to the programming idea of an array.\n",
    "- A **matrix** is a two-dimensional collection of numbers, arranged in rows and columns. Each row and column of a matrix is itself a vector.\n",
    "- A **tensor** is a three or more dimesional collection of numbers.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalars typically get variable names in italics: $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors get variable names with a small arrow above: $\\vec{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices and tensors get variable names with capitol letters: $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Note About the Term \"Dimension\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Because machine learning is a field which combines several different disciplines (mathematics, statistics, and computer science to name a few) there are many ideas which have several names, depending on the context of who is talking and what they are talking about. Additionally, there are some terms that are used to mean several different things.\n",
    "This situation is a common source of confusion for students, so we are drawing explicit attention to it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"dimension\" is one of those words. In the above definitions, \"dimension\" means a count of the number of distinct indices into the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors \n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are collections of values where the order matters (compare with an unordered set).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vector addition\n",
    "* Vector-scalar product\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalar (Dot) Product\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two vectors $\\vec{a} = [a_1 \\, a_2 \\, ... \\, a_N]$ and$\\vec{b} = [b_1 \\, b_2 \\, ... \\, b_N]$, the **scalar product** is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} := \\sum_{i=1}^N a_ib_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this dot product only makes sense when $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\vec{a} = [1, \\, 2, \\, -4]$ and $\\vec{b} = [-1, \\, 10, \\, 3]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 1 \\cdot -1 + 2 \\cdot 10 + -4 \\cdot 3 = 7$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors as \"Direction\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We sometimes think of vectors as being arrows which point in a particular direction.\n",
    "This can be useful when reasoning about vectors geometrically.\n",
    "However, it can be difficult to visualize this once you start condisidering vectors with more than 3 entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fuctions Applied to a Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, for the sake of making notation simpler, we will write a real-valued function $f$ applied to a vector $\\vec{v}$ to mean the application of the function $f$ to each entry of $\\vec{v}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(\\vec{v}) = [f(v_1) \\, f(v_2) \\, ... \\, f(v_N)].$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not typical in a linear algebra class, but is something we will do frequently in deep learning.\n",
